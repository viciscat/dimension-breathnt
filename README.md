# dimension-breathnt
A simple mod for 1.12.2 that makes the player not able to breath in certain dimensions and biomes. Requires TechGuns

Made for someone as training in modding.

# Why techgun :((
I didn't figure how to change the breath of the player without core-modding.
TechGuns was the next best solution with it's oxygen tanks and mask.

Might try one day.
